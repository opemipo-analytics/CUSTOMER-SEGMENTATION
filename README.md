## Business Problem

AEDC has hundreds of customer book codes (zones) across multiple service centres. Without proper segmentation, marketers waste time treating all customers the same — chasing reliable payers while ignoring recoverable ones.

This project uses **SQL + RFM Analysis** to answer:
1. Which book codes are our highest value customers?
2. Which zones are at risk of becoming non-paying?
3. Where should marketers focus their collection efforts?
4. How much revenue is locked in each customer segment?

## What is RFM Analysis?

RFM is one of the most widely used customer segmentation techniques in business analytics:

| Letter | Metric | Question | Scoring |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| **R** | Recency | How recently did they pay? | 3 = most recent |
| **F** | Frequency | How many times did they pay? | 3 = most frequent |
| **M** | Monetary | How much did they pay total? | 3 = highest value |

Combined RFM score determines the customer segment:

| Segment | Score | Description | Action |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Champion | 8-9 | Pays often, pays a lot, paid recently | Protect and reward |
| Loyal | 6-7 | Consistent payers, good value | Prioritise service |
| Promising | 5 | New or growing, showing good signs | Increase visits |
| At Risk | 4 | Used to pay well, dropping off | Urgent outreach |
| Lost | 3 | Inactive, minimal payment history | Recovery campaign |

## Database Structure (SQL)

```sql
-- Customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    book_code      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    zone           TEXT,
    service_centre TEXT,
    customer_pop   INTEGER,
    tariff_band    TEXT
);

-- Transactions table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    book_code        TEXT,
    collection_date  TEXT,
    amount_collected REAL,
    units_kwh        INTEGER,
    customers_paid   INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_code) REFERENCES customers(book_code)
);
```

## Key SQL Queries

### Query 1 — Revenue Summary per Book Code
```sql
SELECT
    t.book_code,
    c.zone,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.collection_date) AS total_visits,
    SUM(t.amount_collected)           AS total_collected,
    AVG(t.amount_collected)           AS avg_per_visit
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.book_code = c.book_code
GROUP BY t.book_code
ORDER BY total_collected DESC
```

### Query 2 — RFM Scoring (Core Logic)
```sql
WITH rfm_base AS (
    SELECT
        book_code,
        JULIANDAY('2021-07-01') - JULIANDAY(MAX(collection_date)) AS recency_days,
        COUNT(DISTINCT collection_date) AS frequency,
        SUM(amount_collected)           AS monetary
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY book_code
)
SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN recency_days <= 1 THEN 3
         WHEN recency_days <= 4 THEN 2
         ELSE 1 END AS r_score,
    CASE WHEN frequency >= 6 THEN 3
         WHEN frequency >= 4 THEN 2
         ELSE 1 END AS f_score,
    CASE WHEN monetary >= 400000 THEN 3
         WHEN monetary >= 200000 THEN 2
         ELSE 1 END AS m_score
FROM rfm_base
```
